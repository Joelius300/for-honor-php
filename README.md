# for-honor-php

My first and hopefully last ever php project. It was created in school and doesn't really have anything to do with for-honor besides being a """fighting game""", it just sounded cool (don't sue me).  

The code is probably as bad as the language itself but, as you might have seen with some other repositories of mine, I like to document what I've done no matter how bad it was.  
It's a way to see how much I improve as a developer over time by, for example, not using php anymore.
